I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.



On behalf of Pearson Education, Inc., I am requesting that you take down (and in the meantime, make private), the following repository as it endangers our IP and makes public keys and data that belong to Pearson and can be used against our company and users.



User: sreejithwpg [private]  

https://github.com/sreejithwpg  

Repos: [private] AND /terraform (https://github.com/sreejithwpg/terraform)



This code belongs to Pearson and has been posted publicly without consent and contains AWS keys that endanger our data and users. (We have been alerted to this danger and request to secure by AWS as well)   



Please make the repo private as soon as possible and take this down.   



Also, is it possible for you to share any information about this user - name, location, etc. Anything that will help in determining the identity or location of the malicious activity will be helpful.   



Thank you.

Pearson Education, Inc.
