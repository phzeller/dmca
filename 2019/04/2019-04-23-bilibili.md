Some one created a Repository called 'openbilibili/go-common' (https://github.com/openbilibili/go-commontwo) hours ago and many people forked it or clone it and reupload the repository,which contained too much sensitive information,such as secret key,database address,very important api key and so on.If these information are found by other people in Github,our company will be left out of pocket.

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about this  Repository:
