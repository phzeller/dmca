Hello Githubï¼Œ

 We are Experian(china). It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

 We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to filing a DMCA Notice.

 Our company created a Repository called "collectsmcf"  in  2017 ,  which contained creators and contents are all owned by the company.  Later found that before we deleted, the user named "Ronnie08" completely forked our entire repository, and it still exists.

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked repository.

Since "collectsmcf" contains the company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal data assets, so we hope github as soon as possible to help us completely remove "Ronnie08/collectsmcf" (https://github.com/Ronnie08/collectsmcf) and thank you very much!
