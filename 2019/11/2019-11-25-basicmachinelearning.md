Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Currently, my repo is in violation of copyright.  
(I reported a dmca before.)  
(dmca report says : delete my repo and request the fork url again)  
repo : [private]

The copyright owner asked me to delete the frozen github repo.  
I am currently in communication with the copyright holder.  
It was my fault, so I decided to take care of it.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

copyright owner repo : [private]   
my repo(is already deleted. the reason is written above) : https://github.com/lsjsj92/basic-machine-learning

I studied while reading the copyright holder's repo.  
It's my fault that I didn't know it was fault

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

3 people are currently fork in my github.  
lists :  
1. https://github.com/dbtmd324/basic-machine-learning  
2. https://github.com/gbrinan/basic-machine-learning

copyright owner want to delete all them.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

it`s not open source.  
this is a repo by a book(python machine learning book)

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repo has been initialized first at the request of the copyright holder.  
Currently the repo has been deleted at the request of the previous dmca.  
And the copyright owner's request wants the forked to be deleted.  
And I want it, too.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't know the contact number. I've already asked a user who knows his contact number to delete it. And the user's repo has now been deleted.

There are currently 3 people left, but there are no contacts.  
Currently, I have left a deletion request in the other repo of each account.
