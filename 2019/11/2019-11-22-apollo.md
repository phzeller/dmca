As a licensee of the copyrighted content, I have authorization to request that all forks of the owner's software be removed from Github and all other copies of the software be destroyed.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The repository named "aseries-apollo" was accidentally made public on Github. It contains software identified as copyright MediaTek, Inc. Several Github users made forks of this copyrighted material without permission. The original repository has since been converted to a private repository, but public forks still exist.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
The entire repository shall be removed:  
https://github.com/iroot/aseries-apollo  
All forks of the original repository shall be removed:  
https://github.com/dr2006/aseries-apollo  
https://github.com/freeflyfish/aseries-apollo  
https://github.com/goodsirlee/aseries-apollo  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
YES

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
The software is not open source. Each copyrighted file indicates this in the comments at the top of the file.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
The entire repository, including all software in it, must be entirely removed from Github. All other copies of the software must be destroyed.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
