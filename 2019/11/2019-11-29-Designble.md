**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My code, my photos, my friends' photo and the logo of our web design agency is being used in a meant-to-be-private code made public by an ex-coworker. I and my friends' / co-workers does not authorize him to use our code and especially our photos and names.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our source code is not public and designed & developed for a web design agency of ours from scratch including the ex-coworker, my friend and myself. After a decision we've come, we had to make the ex-coworker leave from our agency and because of this act of ours, he became angry or jealous resulting in the publishing of our private code and content of ours (photos and names) which we do NOT authorize either the ex-coworker or GitHub.

Also as an addition to our takedown request, we HAVEN'T authorized the alleged infringer to use our logo nor our name in a public template. This and all those other mentioned should be taken down, including the code.

For this DMCA request, I've made the repository he got the code from that I own from the beginning (that you can prove from the git dates):

https://github.com/ardacebi/designble

We do NOT permit him to use this code he stole and the repo mentioned below will be made private when this DMCA case closes with a result.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Yutyo/designble
This whole repository is himself copying and publishing our private code to the public. This should be taken down completely.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/steinstill/designble
This is a fork of the repository he published originally, I guess it's a repo of one of his friends to secure the deletion of the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is NOT open source and NOT meant to be open source. It's for a commercially operating web design agency and we do NOT accept the ex-coworker to use our code, photos, names and the logo of our agency in a stolen code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository should be deleted. We've talked with the alleged infringer about the issue and they do NOT accept the removal of OUR CONTENT including PHOTOS, NAMES, and CODE of OURS.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
