I'm [private] of MonBuilding.  
MonBuilding is a software company offering a mobile and web application for buildings. The code of our mobile app, of which we are the legal owners pursuant to French and international laws regarding "droit d'auteur" and copyright, has been published on your website, without our prior authorization and in violation of our legal rights.  
Our trademark - which is duly registered in France, under number 4279112 - and our logo - which is also protected by "droit d'auteur" and copyright laws - have also been unlawfuly published on your website.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringed content is the code of our mobile application, which is a paying SaaS sofware made available to businesses.

You can find further information on our website, which also includes our infringed trademark:   https://www.monbuilding.com/fr.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories must be taken down. Their URLs are:  
- https://github.com/juanstack/monbuilding  
- https://github.com/Big-Silver/monbuilding  
These repositories are copies of one another.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

N/A

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories must be removed ASAP and we need to be given information on users “juanstack” and “Big-Silver” in order to prevent them from continuing violating our rights.

This is a major breach of our IP rights, which is likely to have disastrous consequences on our business and result in major financial losses if the repository is not taken down immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We don't. Please provide any information you have so we can identify “juanstack” and “Big-Silver” and initiate legal proceedings to protect our IP.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
