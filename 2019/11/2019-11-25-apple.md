[3]        I have a good faith belief that the content at the URLs below is unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the content offers to distribute a circumvention tool designed with the specific purposes of circumventing the technological protection mechanisms of Apple’s copyrighted iOS/iPadOS software. Specifically, the repository hosts an iCloudBypassCA.pkg installer, which installs an iCloud unlocking tool, which circumvents the technological protection measures that effectively control access to Apple’s copyright iOS software. The repository “offer[s] to the public, provide[s], or otherwise traffic[s]” in this circumvention technology, which has no other commercially significant purpose;
