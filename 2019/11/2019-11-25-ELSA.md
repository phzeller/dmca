**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I represent the copyright owner, ELSA, in filing this DMCA takedown notice as their legal counsel.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

ELSA Speak is a mobile phone application that includes language learning lessons. The copyrighted work that has been infringed consists primarily of the source code comprising the app. The app can be viewed and downloaded at:
-Google's Google Play, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.nobarriers.elsa&hl=en_US
-Apple's App Store, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elsa-speak-accent-reduction/id1083804886 and
-ELSA's website, https://elsaspeak.com/

There is no available public link to the source code content that is being distributed illegally in Github. The app content is located exclusively behind a paywall so that only paying customers can access it.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socialless/elsa/master/modules/download

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Will update as information becomes available.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal of the infringing content.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. The infringing content on Github is by redirect from an offering of the infringing content by a private user ("Ghostkiller") on a file sharing website. The private user makes ELSA’s copyrighted content, including full lessons, available for download at https://www.gocmod.com/2019/11/elsa-speak-v999-mod.html?m=1&fbclid=IwAR0N-wjf_5PBKyIC96QsINporZEj_Md3C3Ez6fo0SazAVqcdJuCBj6MKQ1Q

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
