Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,  
  
   
  
I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
   
  
I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  
  
   
  
[1]        I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section 1201(a)(2) or 1201(b)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or “DMCA”;

[3]        I have a good faith belief that the content at the URLs below is unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the content offers to distribute a circumvention tool designed with the specific purposes of circumventing the technological protection mechanisms of Apple’s copyrighted iOS/iPadOS software. Specifically, the repository hosts an iCloudBypassCA.pkg installer, which installs an iCloud unlocking tool, which circumvents the technological protection measures that effectively control access to Apple’s copyright iOS software. The repository “offer[s] to the public, provide[s], or otherwise traffic[s]” in this circumvention technology, which has no other commercially significant purpose;  
  
   
  
[4]        Reason:  
  
Content Type:            Apple Inc.’s Copyrighted iOS/iPadOS Software  
  
Violation(s):               Distribution of Circumvention Tool
