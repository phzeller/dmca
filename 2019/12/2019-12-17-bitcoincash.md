**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the sole author.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Bitcoin Cash smart contract compiler which is available here: https://bitbucket.org/o-studio/spedn/src/master/ and documented here: https://spedn.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.7/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/scrypt-sv/specification <- the overall structure and significant portions of this repository (especially https://github.com/scrypt-sv/specification/blob/master/docs/syntax.rst) is copied from documentation of my work and should be taken down or the original copyright and license should be restored.

I also suspect that besides this public repository there might be another, private one which might contain portions of my code and which might violate the license too.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, MIT.
The reported repository infriges it by not including the original copyright and licensing the content under some obscure proprietary license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

He should restore the original MIT license with the original copyright notice: “Copyright (c) 2018 {o} Software”.

He should neither limit the use of the software to some particular blockchain nor forbid reverse engineering.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

no
