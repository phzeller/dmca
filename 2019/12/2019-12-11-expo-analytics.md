**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the author and copyright holder of the popular React Native, MIT licensed project at https://github.com/ryanvanderpol/expo-analytics. A GitHub user ([private]) created an illegal copy (not a fork) with no attribution at: https://github.com/mediusoft/expo-analytics-google.

This person has created a copy of my work and has published that copy to the NPM registry.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
 
Original: https://github.com/ryanvanderpol/expo-analytics  
Original published NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-analytics (originally published in Sept 2017)  

Copy: https://github.com/mediusoft/expo-analytics-google (created in Nov 2019)  
Copy published NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-analytics-google (created in Nov 2019)  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

this entire repository is a copy: https://github.com/mediusoft/expo-analytics-google

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks have been created as of now.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The original work is licensed under the MIT license, which requires attribution. The copy does not include any attribution and is therefore in violation of the original license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

If the user creates a proper fork, and includes the required attribution, that is fine, but at this point I would prefer the entire repository to be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
