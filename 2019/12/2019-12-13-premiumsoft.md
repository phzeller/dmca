Not at this time. We will file separate notices if we find any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No it is not.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No. Removal is the only option.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have their contact information.

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**What technological measures have been put in place that are being violated?**

We have put in a licensing system that works both online and offline. The offline part of the licensing system is being abused in this case by the keygen shown in this DMCA notice generating confirmation codes for licensing Navicat products. These confirmation codes are usually only issuable by employees but this keygen allows anybody to issue them.

**How does this repo or repos violate your technological measure or measures?**

It violates our technological measures by the repo holding the source code and the compiled application to a custom-created keygen which is built to bypass our licensingsystem and allows end users to create their own unique confirmation codes for offline activation without legitimately buying the product which therefore bypasses our technological measures.
