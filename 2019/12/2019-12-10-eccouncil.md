Dear Sir/Madam,  

INFRINGEMENT OF EC-COUNCIL’S COPYRIGHTS & TRADEMARKS: DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE  

EC-Council is the owner of the copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the “Certified Ethical Hacker” and “CEH”. EC Council owns and controls the rights to use, including but not limited to the name, materials, courses, products and associated properties relating to “Certified Ethical Hacker” and “CEH”.  

A number of links that your company hosts are infringing or at least one (1) if not more copyright owned by my company. “Certified Ethical Hacker” and “CEH” are being offered in your site and being conducted without permission. The courses are official “Certified Ethical Hacker” and “CEH”, courses which are only taught to EC-Council’s students via EC-Council’s authorized training centres or academia partners.  

Information and list of modules of “Certified Ethical Hacker” and “CEH” can be viewed at the following link:

This letter is an official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), and we seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing materials/courses from your servers immediately without any delay and to cease any further posting of infringing materials/courses to your server in the future.  

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to expeditiously remove or disable access to the infringing material upon receiving this notice. Noncompliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under the DMCA. Under US law, a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material/courses this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action, you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material/courses from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.  

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.  

Should you require any other information from EC-Council, please do not hesitate to write directly to me. Kindly note a copy of this legal notice is being retained in my office and over email for further necessary legal action.
