We (Microsoft) ship a set of extensions for Visual Studio Code which provide "remote" access to [Virtual Machines over SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl). We also publish an ["remote extension pack"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which combines the various Remote extensions into a single download. We maintain the public repository [microsoft/vscode-remote-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release) to track issues for these extensions, but we do not host the source code here because the source code is closed source.  

All of these extensions and the public repository have the following license: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack/license  

In section 7, the license states [You may not] “reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the software;”.  

The following repositories contain source code that has been reverse engineered by extracting minified source code from the distribution on disk.  

https://github.com/vscode-remote/remote-ssh  
https://github.com/vscode-remote/remote-wsl  
https://github.com/vscode-remote/vscode-remote-extensionpack  
https://github.com/vscode-remote/remote-ssh-edit  

In fact, the description of the vscode-remote/remote-ssh, vscode-remote/remote-ssh-edit, and vscode-remote/remotes-wsl all state that they are “unminfiy and rewritten” from the sources on disk.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**
