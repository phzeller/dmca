I am the copyright holder of most of the code in this repository: https://github.com/CharlieIsMyName/TorontoMap .

This repository contains the major assignment and various support code for the course ECE 297 at the University of Toronto. The repository contains not only the code written by the student (and two teammates) to complete the assignment, but incorporates skeleton code written by the course teaching team ([private]). Leaving this repository online violates my copyright and that of the University of Toronto to the code created for the course. Having this repository public also encourages plagiarism by future students as 350 students a year take this course, and the course project is too complex to completely change each year -- hence being able to download a complete solution from a prior year encourages weaker students to copy, and harms those students who are completing the course in the proper way by creating their own solution.

Code that was entirely written by myself and the teaching team includes:  
All files in https://github.com/CharlieIsMyName/TorontoMap/tree/master/libstreetsdatabase/src  
https://github.com/CharlieIsMyName/TorontoMap/blob/master/Makefile  
All files in https://github.com/CharlieIsMyName/TorontoMap/tree/master/libstreetmap/tests  
Many of the files in https://github.com/CharlieIsMyName/TorontoMap/tree/master/libstreetmap/src (graphics.cpp, graphics.h, easygl_constants.h, m1.h, m2.h, m3.h, m4.h)  

Some of the other files in this directory include example skeleton code as part of their implementation.

Taking down the repository or making the repository private would both be acceptable.
