Takedown notice:  
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/11/2019-11-25-msft.md  

The repository: "CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator" does not violate Microsoft copyright on the following product:  
Windows 7 TX 7-009-361  
Windows 8 -TX 7-601-008  
Windows 8.1 -TX 7-740-695  
Windows 10 -TX 8-058-526  
Windows Server 2008 TX 6-880-740  
Windows Server 2012 TX 7-622-123  
Windows Server 2016 TX 8-204-163  
Windows Server 2019 TX 8-659-104  
Microsoft Office 2010 -TX 7-219-968  
Microsoft Office 2013 TX 7-649-882  
Microsoft Office 2016 TX 8-097-602  
Microsoft Office 2019 TX 8-748-909  

Because Key Management Service (KMS) is a genuine activation method provided by Microsoft for volume licensing customers (organizations, schools or governments). The machines in those environments (called KMS clients) activate via the environment KMS host server (authorized Microsoft's licensing key), not via Microsoft activation servers.  

See here for more information:

The KMS emulators are mimic the KMS server/client communications, and provide a clean activation for the supported KMS clients, without altering or hacking any system files integrity, this procedure is not against MS own copyright, it's a gray-zone at worst because the procedure is done locally which do not interfering into the original product activation mechanism.  

The scripts and tools only accessing 3 parts of the system (if the emulator is used):  
* "C:\Windows\System32\SppExtComObjHook.dll"  
* "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options"  
* ... and osppsvc.exe keys to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform"  

My repository does not provide any links to VLC (volume-capable) products. The user has to convert a retail product first into a volume product, and this is not part of the repository.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

- This repository does not support nor links to VLC based Microsoft Office/Windows products. All includes links are the official ones provided by MS.  
- The included keys are generic ones, these keys are been public posted by Microsoft. See here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys  
- The source code for all files are provided, Microsoft did not explicitly mention which files are violating their copyright. It's more than vague to say "this repository contains material which violates our copyright" without linking to specific files or point to the source code directly.  
- My repository does not "illegal activate" Windows/Office, the emulation process is a hole which Microsoft can patch at any time, and they still leave it open. There are millions of other websites with illegal malware activators, why does MS do not take them down?  
- Microsoft writes "These are no open ports to access these products." I agree here, and there are no direct links nor converters utilities given nor mention in my repository. The repository is useless without volume license converts Microsoft Windows or MS office products, and that#s why it's for research reasons only.  
- The "activation" needs an KMS server, which is not provided in this repository, the activation will fail if no KMS server is been set up.  

I added a FAQ for Microsoft, so they can see how the project really works, the URL is available over here:
