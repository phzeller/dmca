Yesterday GCP notified us of Service Account keys compromised:  

https://github.com/sublime-whisky/.personal/blob/bd66c48354384350660abdf9c64e07d46ce9af32/adapters/terravion/3-register-and-clip-BATCH/semios-vliao-test-project-b68b77e62421.json

https://github.com/sublime-whisky/.personal/blob/47d783a018e12fa5ee4af67a93b91058a913f11a/adapters/terravion/3-register-and-clip-BATCH/test-service-account.json

We looked around the repos of this user and we believe it is [private]. As of November 28, 2019, [private] is no longer an employee of Semios. While some of this may be unintentional since some of it is commit trees within .personal. There was a repo updated a few days ago which is code he developed while employed by Semios but never completed/committed into our repos.

https://github.com/sublime-whisky/nasa_mod16a2

The first commits to this repo even contained references to the semios resources in the readme (as of right now this is still the case with the latest commit), for example, https://github.com/sublime-whisky/nasa_mod16a2/commit/2a9ef87b9a17a119193968f8f2ac2bedfeeabc6a :
"semios-imagery-service-account-cred \
--from-file="<file name:semios-imagery-e744dbbc91bb.json>=<local path:/Users/vinvancan/cred/semios-imagery-e744dbbc91bb.json>"

Also, if you search through the commit logs in the .personal files, you will see a LICENSE file that contains information that we consider this code copyright, for example: https://github.com/sublime-whisky/.personal/blob/47d783a018e12fa5ee4af67a93b91058a913f11a/LICENSE.md
and you will find commits by other active semios employees, as well as by [private] (his user name while employed by Semios, https://github.com/[private]).

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There don't appear to be any forks of this code at this time

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This work is not open source

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We want all Semios code and history removed that [private] has posted to the sublime-whiskey GitHub account linked above and any local copies the user possesses needs to be deleted. We also want the [private] user account deleted/disabled.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
