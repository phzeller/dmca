I am the copyright holder of most of the code in this repository: https://github.com/yuxincheng73/ECE297 .

This repository contains the major assignment and various support code for the course ECE 297 at the University of Toronto. The repository contains not only the code written by the student (and two teammates) to complete the assignment, but also the code written by the course teaching team ([private]) that provides the bulk of the assignment functionality. Leaving this repository online violates my copyright and that of the University of Toronto to the code created for the course. Having this repository public also encourages plagiarism by future students as 350 students a year take this course, and the course project is too complex to completely change each year -- hence being able to download a complete solution from a prior year encourages weaker students to copy, and harms those students who are completing the course in the proper way by creating their own solution.

The entire repository is the course assignment and supporting utilities.  Code that was written by the teaching team ([private]) and is owned by the University of Toronto includes:  
All files in https://github.com/yuxincheng73/ECE297/tree/master/src/ezgl  
Much of the code in https://github.com/yuxincheng73/ECE297/blob/master/main/src/main.cpp (note the copyright header)  

This constitutes the majority of the code in this repository, and at the minimum this code should be taken down.

The other source files in this repository were written for the course and many include smaller amounts of code written by the teaching team. These files also should not be published on a public website, so it would be best if the entire repository was taken down. The copyright status of these other source files is less clear as it was not completely written by the teaching team (but portions are copied from the skeleton files provided as part of the course). However, it is subject to the University of Toronto's policies on work submitted for credit in a course.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I have searched for forks but have not found any public ones.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

Taking down the repository or making the repository private would both be acceptable.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

No, I do not have current contact information.
