Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the author of the Lumpen Radio App (https://appsto.re/us/NdeV7.i)

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Lumpen Radio https://git.habd.as/comfusion/lumpen-radio/ is a service provider app allowing users to request to stream audio over the internet based on a constant stream URL set in the app. I authored Lumpen Radio during a 3 month period in 2015 to help a radio station WPLN FM 1055.5 Chicago which endorses products under the name "Lumpen Radio". The application design, code and interface were authored by myself before submitting Lumpen Radio and receiving admittance to the Apple App Store in 2015 (http://appsto.re/us/NdeV7.i). My work on Lumpen Radio was later featured in Facebook's React Native Showcase with my name and the icon I designed for the app (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/2337#issue-42484703). During development I granted Public Media Institute, the organization behind WLPN FM 105.5 Chicago a non-exclusive license to use my work under the terms of the MIT license. The application in its entirety was developed without fee. Original artwork included in app, used with permission and attributed in the source README file.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Specifically, any file which duplicates the expression of my original design. The current form of the infringing work uses rasterized duplicates of an SVG I created using shell scripting and InkScape as documented on my blog   https://habd.as/post/automating-ios-app-icon-creation/ and located in my application source code here:   https://git.habd.as/comfusion/lumpen-radio/src/branch/master/iOS/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset.

Here are the files I found on GitHub I believe to be infringing of my rights:

In addition to the app icon, infringing work attempts to reproduce my screen design in its entirety when viewed in binary form.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

BSD-3-clause, previously MIT

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I'd like all expressive elements of my design removed from the source code and git history modified so they do not appear at all. I also do not want to see the same exact design in the compiled app, which I will take up with Apple should the infringer submit a duplicate app (as it currently stands) to the app store.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
