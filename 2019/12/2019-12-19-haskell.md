**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I listed the forks above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It's licensed with all rights reserved in the United States.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

All repositories must be made private or removed. Their reproduction of content from the book way exceeds what's allowed under fair use.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't know how to reach them.
