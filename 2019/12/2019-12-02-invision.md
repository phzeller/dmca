**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I was alerted by YOU via a reply to a previous DMCA which I filed, that the above forks were present in a URL I filed previously. This is a followup. I do not know if subsequent forks were made from the above URL's, but this is a start.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The entire contents of EACH repository above, at the listed URL's, are our licensed and copyrighted work.  
This is not open source software in ANY manner, and are in violation of our license terms.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

These repositories must be permanently removed.  
Our license terms do not allow storing the software anywhere that the public can access it.  
It may be stored only on the site where it is running, or on the licensee's local computer, and none of the repository owners appear to be licensed in the first place.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have any contact info. As noted above, these repositories were forks of a repo which reported to me in the Piracy department as distributing our software, and this complaint is a followup of a DMCA I filed a few days ago.  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
