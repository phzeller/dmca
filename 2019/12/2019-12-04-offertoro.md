**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

This is a SDK file we created in order to let our customers use and access to our services.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

One of our customers created an application and posed the application repository on GitHub publicly. This repository contains our SDK as an AAR file.
This is a private file that we provide to our customers exclusively. Exposing this file also exposes our API and misleads our customers to use this outdated SDK file in their applications. This creates a possible security hack and bugs for our customers using this outdated SDK.

Link to the repository where the aar file is: https://github.com/sukhyna-mykola/PSNGiftCardsGenerator/find/master.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Link to the exact file: https://github.com/sukhyna-mykola/PSNGiftCardsGenerator/blob/master/app/libs/OfferToroSdk-v3.1.0.aar

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks were found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This SDK is not an open source code and is provided only to our customers.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Yes, if the repository will become private that will solve our problem as well.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes, we have tried to contact him via phone and email but got no response.
We have also noticed that his app is offline.
