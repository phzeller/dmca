Hi, Dear Github  

This is Beijing Kingsoft Cloud Network Technology Co., Ltd. We’re happy to be able to use your professional and efficient platform, and we’re eager to get your support and solutions currently.  

We have read and understood the intention to submit DMCA notices.  

On January 11, 2019, we found a project called "[private]" showed in your platform. Due to the important configuration data of our company, we found the relevant personnel to delete the project immediately, but after that, we found that the account named "P79N6A" has a fork copy and it still exists (https://github.com/P79N6A/--1).

Here are screenshots of the URL and fork branch in Github:

Since the files in "P79N6A/--1" account contain important configuration information and internal data assets of our company, we hope that Github could help us to delete the “P79N6A/--1” as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
