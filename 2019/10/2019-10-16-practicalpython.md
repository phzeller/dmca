**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, my work is not under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I'm getting tired of having to submit DMCA takedowns to you guys. The best solution would be for you guys to implement file hashing methods to prevent people from uploading illegal files. It's frustrating that you don't already and content creators have to spend their time filling out these damn reports.

Also note that I've had to copy and paste 200+ links for you guys to take down -- links that you can easily query your database for. It's getting to the point where I feel that I should be allowed to invoice you for my time spent on these DMCA requests.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
