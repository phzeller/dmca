**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not under an open source license. This user is in violation of the license grant to not distribute the source code as specified in the License Grant. Additionally the work is licensed under a proprietary license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

For the user @jeffaco I have verified what I believe to be a purchase of said software based on his name on his GitHub profile. Changing the repository to private is acceptable. For all other forks, removal is the correct action since the license non-transferrable or able to be sub-licensed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
