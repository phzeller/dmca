With very few exceptions, the other files in these repositories all appear to be either directly authored by [private], or directly derived from work authored by [private].  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All of these repositories must be taken down entirely. While [private] provided a single example of infringement in each of the repositories, the majority of each of these repositories appears to be either [private], or files that are directly derived from [private] work, without attribution or permission.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have attempted to search for forks; the ones that I have located, to date, are included in the above list.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No: the infringed work has never been licensed under any open-source license. It is [private] work, and has never been authorized for public release.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No: [private] unwilling to license any of [private] work to support the purpose of these repositories (which appears to be solely to enable students to cheat on their coursework).

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not, but would be interested in receiving it: this is also an academic offense at the University of Toronto.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
